## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Karin, new to programming and tech, keen to learn everything I can.


## ðŸŒ± About Me


My background is in:

- **Social protection**, that includes large public programmes such as unemployment insurance, disability and housing support, or social work.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)**, which is about understanding whether (public) programmes achieve what they set out to. In practice, this includes data collection and analysis, or theories of change and logframes
